{"name":"AdaWM","tagline":"Tiling window manager written in Ada.","body":"### Goals and aim\r\nAdaWM aims to be a well thought out and simple tiling window\r\nmanager for Linux. It owes a large part of it's design to the magnificent window manager i3.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Goals and Features\r\n* Scriptability using an IPC\r\n* Good handling of multi monitor set-ups using RandR or Xinerama\r\n* Containers implemented as a tree data structure\r\n* Easily readable and well thought out code\r\n\r\n\r\n### Requirements?\r\nTo run AdaWM you need\r\n* An Ada compiler\r\n* The GNATCOLL toolkit (Used for the tree data structure and commandline parsing)\r\n* The X Ada binding, xab\r\n\r\n\r\n### Roadmap\r\n* Further finishing and polishing of the code\r\n* Produce secondary tools like an IPC client, bar etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Todo/Bugs\r\n* Most of the basic window manager code still needs work, as of now it doesn't actually manage any windows\r\n* RandR is currently bypassed and faked by using a screen as large as the outputs combined, it should be properly implemented\r\n* Xinerama is not implemented at all, but this is low priority\r\n","google":"UA-11118774-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
